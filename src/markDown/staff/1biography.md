#Biography

My name is Dr Marie-Thérèse Proctor. For more than 20 years, whether as a clinician, educator, academic, or researcher I have been passionate about supporting, equipping and encouraging individuals to learn, heal, grow and flourish, personally and professionally.

I am an PhD trained, AHPRA registered psychologist with Medicare provider rights, and Master trained psychotherapist, providing short-term and long-term psychological and psychotherapeutic care for adults of varied ages. As an mental health educator, I can provide (i) educational training and professional development workshop for churches, communities groups and allied healthcare professionals; and (ii) supervision and mentoring of chaplains and allied healthcare professionals, with an emphasis on reflective practice, professional formation, growth and maturation.

##A clinician

Using a relationally focused, collaborative approach, I seek to co-create a safe therapeutic space where each client can explore his or her sense of well-being and bio-psycho-social and spiritual health. I have a keen interest in issues related to:

- Human and Spiritual Attachment
- Spirituality and Health
- Carers’ Needs and Issues
- Grief, Loss and Times of Change
- Attachment and Complex Trauma

As a result, my training, research and employment choices have all related in some way to these areas of interest (See Past Roles). For example, during my Master’ degree I trained in ‘The Conversational Model’, evidence-based psychodynamic training in Complex Trauma. During the same degree I submitted a research thesis exploring the relationship between early developmental trauma and adult Christian spirituality, this since published in the Journal of Spirituality and Mental Health. This work built on prior training and research in the areas of human and spiritual attachment.

I understand the desire to live a full, purposeful and meaningful life, working with each client to find his/her unique expression of this. Focused on the ‘whole person’ (body-mind-spirit), I support clients as they explore the psychological, spiritual, social and physiological elements of their life, helping clients to develop and sustain a healthy and stable sense of self and positive relationships with others.

##An educator

I am passionate about transmitting knowledge in ways that are helpful, relevant and applicable to the circumstances of learners. I enjoy sharing knowledge and observing the ‘ah ha’ moments when learners can see where new information can be used in their personal and professional lives in ways that improve and enhance their sense of self, relationship with others and their positive participation in, and contribution to the world. Not surprisingly, teaching and developing programs of study has formed part of my work life. For example, when Head of a Graduate Counselling School with the support of a group of highly experienced Christian educators and clinicians we designed and developed an industry standard suite of post graduate degrees in counselling.

##A researcher

For as long as I can remember I have had a curious mind, full of questions about so many things. Perhaps not surprisingly this found expression through my work as a researcher. Whether undertaking individual research during my Honours and PhD degrees, working in collaboration with peers or teaching students about the research process, I experience research as engaging, challenging and rewarding. Many of my employment roles have included research, resulting in a range of presentations and publications (see Research page).
