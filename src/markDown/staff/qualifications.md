# Qualifications

My clinical work is informed by ongoing professional development and my original academic training. Each year the Psychology Board of Australia requires all psychologists to complete mandatory professional development to ensure clients are provided with relevant, evidence-based, contemporary psychological care. In training to become a psychologist I completed four higher education degrees.

- A Bachelor degree with a double major in Psychology and Religious Studies from the University of Sydney - BA (Psych/Rel.Studies);
- A Bachelor degree with a First Class Honours in Psychology and a University Medal from the University of Western Sydney – BA (HonsPsych – Class 1/University Medal);{' '}
- A Masters degree in Psychotherapy from the University of Sydney - MScMed (Psychotherapy).
- A Doctorate in the discipline of Psychology from the University of Western Sydney - PhD

As part of my training I completed substantive research theses, which focused on some aspect of spirituality and health (e.g., spiritual attachment, developmental trauma and adult Christian spirituality):

- Proctor, M-T. (2014). Christians with chronic complex trauma and relationally-focused spiritual difficulties: A Conversational Model perspective, Master’s Thesis, Westmead Psychotherapy Research Program, Faulty of Medicine, University of Sydney, Australia.
- Proctor, M-T. (2006). The God Attachment Interview Schedule: Implicit and explicit assessment of attachment to God, Doctoral Dissertation (Psychology), School of Psychology, University of Western Sydney, Australia.
- Proctor, M-T. (1998). Attachment to God: Is it a viable concept?: The relationship between attachment to God, child and adult attachment experiences, God concept and the quality and nature of relationship with God. Psychology Honours Thesis: School of Psychology, University of Western Sydney, Australia.
