#Clinical Supervision

Engaging in continued reflection about oneâ€™s clinical work is a requirement for all healthcare professionals and those working within church settings. Consequently, your psychologist participates in regular supervision with experienced peers, to ensure the continuance of quality and relevant care to all clients. Peer supervision using de-identified client information is one aspect of mandated professional development psychologists must complete annually.
