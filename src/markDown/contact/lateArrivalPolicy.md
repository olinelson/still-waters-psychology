title: 'Late Arrival Policy'
---

Where clients arrive late for a session, the session will still end at the scheduled time, meaning that session will be shorter on that occasion. Time has been reserved for you and only you at the agreed upon time, with other people are scheduled after your time. This approach ensures those attending after you are not kept waiting. Thank you for your understanding in relation to this matter.
