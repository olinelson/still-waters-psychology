#Location

The practice is located at 20-24 John Street Camden (cross street is Mitchell Street).

The practice is housed within the Camden Uniting Church (Mezzanine Office). Upon arrival (during the daytime) you can enter via the side screen door. Please register your presence using the Still Waters Psychology QR code on the wall (just inside the door) OR the Alternate Tracing Register (on the chair) and take a seat in the provided tub chair. Under current COVID restrictions this is an entry requirement for accessing practice services. You are also required to complete a COVID Health Screening Tool. Where clients report any symptoms (or symptoms among their family/workplace etc) they cannot attend in person and an alternate appointment via Telehealth will be arranged. The main office door will be opened at the time of your appointment. For evening appointments, please remain in your car until your appointment time at which time the outside screen door will be opened. This increased security at night is to protect both clients and staff.
