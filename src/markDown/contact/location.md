#Location

The practice is located just off Narellan Road, Narellan. When you
turn into Exchange Parade there is an entry driveway on the left
BEFORE the first roundabout. You will need to drive round the bend and
approximately half-way along the shop fronts to reach the practice
location. In the event you miss the first driveway, proceed to the
first roundabout, turn left and there is a 2nd entry driveway (on the
left).

The practice is housed within the Narellan Community Congregational
Church. Upon arrival, please enter the church foyer and turn left to
find the practice reception area. Please make yourself comfortable in
the waiting area. Please note the church reception desk is not always
occupied.
