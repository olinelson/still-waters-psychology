title: 'Cancelation Policy'
---

We respect that your time is valuable, and we appreciate that you
understand ours is too. Regretfully cancellation fees are
necessary as it unlikely that your spot can be given to another
client at such short note.

- A 90% cancellation fee will be applied when clients cancel
  within 48 hours of their appointment.

When cancelling a session, please advise as to the reason for the
cancellation. Please note Medicare do not reimburse cancelled
fees, while the NDIA cover a limited number of cancellation fees.
If you have concerns about this policy, please discuss them with
your therapist.

There are rare occasions when, with regret, your therapist needs
to cancel a session due to unexpected circumstances. Where this
occurs, you will be offered a replacement appointment at a
mutually convenient time, at the normal session fee. We apologise
for any inconvenience arising from these rare occasions.
