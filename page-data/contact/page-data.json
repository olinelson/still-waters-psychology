Please register your presence using the Still Waters Psychology QR code on the wall (just inside the door) OR the Alternate Tracing Register (on the chair) and take a seat in the provided tub chair. Under current COVID restrictions this is an entry requirement for accessing practice services. You are also required to complete a COVID Health Screening Tool. Where clients report any symptoms (or symptoms among their family/workplace etc) they cannot attend in person and an alternate appointment via Telehealth will be arranged. The main office door will be opened at the time of your appointment. For evening appointments, please remain in your car until your appointment time at which time the outside screen door will be opened. This increased security at night is to protect both clients and staff.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Location"}}]},"trees":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/2f3a932725956c6588fc967d3dedc10d/be86c/contact.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2f3a932725956c6588fc967d3dedc10d/d59a3/contact.jpg 200w,\n/static/2f3a932725956c6588fc967d3dedc10d/deb97/contact.jpg 400w,\n/static/2f3a932725956c6588fc967d3dedc10d/be86c/contact.jpg 800w,\n/static/2f3a932725956c6588fc967d3dedc10d/cb254/contact.jpg 1200w,\n/static/2f3a932725956c6588fc967d3dedc10d/ec36a/contact.jpg 1600w,\n/static/2f3a932725956c6588fc967d3dedc10d/ae883/contact.jpg 5616w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
